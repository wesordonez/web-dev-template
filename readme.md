## Local development

Follow the below steps for local development setup:

1. Ensure a new repo has been created using this template ('https://github.com/wesordonez/web-dev-template')

2. Create a virtual environment for local development

```py
python3 venv -venv
python3 source bin activate
```

3. Install dependencies

```py
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Add a `.env` file inside the `project` folder using the included `.env.dev` file as a guide.

Required env variables are:
- SECRET_KEY
- Development Database Variables (default configuration is for postgres but sqlite would work too)

> **NOTE:** The secret key is generated using the `get_random_secret_key()` function. Copy this into the `.env` file and delete the print statement AFTER the databases and tables have been migrated

5. Create a new database in postgres (PGAdmin 4) with the name used in the env variabl `SQL_NAME`

6. Now in your terminal create database tables using

```
python manage.py migrate
```
Your database should be created and ready to use.

> **IMPORTANT:** This step should not be skipped as it may cause problems in the migration history order requiring a restart.

7. The migrate command should have triggered the `get_random_secret_key()` function outputing a secret key. This should be copied into the `env` file at this time and the printstatement commented out. A new secret key should be created for the production secret when time for deployment. 

8. Now run the website from the terminal using.

```py
python manage.py runserver
```
Your website should be available at: http://localhost:8000/

Test the website works and the contact form successfully writes data to the created database.

9. To run Tailwind CSS open a new terminal and run:
```py
npm install tailwindcss
npm install cross-env
npm install postcss-simple-vars
```
Then you should be able to start tailwind which will auto update and watch for changes using this command:
```py
python manage.py tailwind start
```

10. Create admin superuser using the following command in terminal:
```py
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Follow the prompts and test at: https:localhost:8000/admin/

## Trouble Shooting
**Note:** If you are facing problems starting this program in windows OS, remove logging from project/settings.py

## Customizing

All html, css, js and assets lies inside the templates.
- To modify the landing page, update `home.html`.
- To add link to header and footer or modify head tags, check `base.html`.
- extend `base.html` to have the same footer and header.

### Adding title, description to page
To add title to a page use the following tags
```py
{% block title %}lorem impsum {% endblock title %}
{% block description %}lorem impsum{% endblock description %} #meta description

{% block socialTitle %}{{blog.title}} | {% endblock socialTitle %} # open graph title, for socials
{% block socialDescription %}{{blog.meta_description}}{% endblock socialDescription %} # open graph description, for socials
{% block pageType %}article{% endblock pageType %}
{% block pageImage %}{% endblock pageImage %} # social image
```

To add additional head tags

```py
{% block head_tags %}lorem impsum {% endblock head_tags %}
```
To add scripts at the end of the elements
```
{% block scripts %}
    <script src="{% static "" %}" />
{% endblock scripts %}
```

## Deployment:

Follow Dunosis documentation to deploy to Digital Ocean App Platform using GitHub Actions. 

Alternatively (with additional set up):

Deploy to vercel

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FPaulleDemon%2FDjango-website-template&demo-title=Django%20website%20template&demo-description=A%20starters%20template%20for%20django%20developers%2C%20freelancers%20and%20agencies&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fdjango-website-template.vercel.app%2F)

or

You can make use of Railway to deploy your own instance.

</a>

Link to deploy to [Railway.app](https://railway.app?referralCode=BfMDHP)

once you complete make sure to 
```
python manage.py collectstatic
```
and set
```
DEBUG=0
```

**Note:** don't forget to set the sites to your domain instead of example.com in the admin panel

### Create a firebase credential file

>**Note:** We'll be using firebase for persistent storage, to upload user files. Firebase is pre-configured as there are other firebase services developers may want to use. <br><br> You can also use any of the storage supported by [django-storages](https://github.com/jschneier/django-storages), if you don't want to use firebase.

To use Firebase

1. We use Google storage for storing files. Go to firebase -> storage -> create (make it public)

2. Now Go to firebase -> project settings -> service account -> Generate new private key.

Rename the private as `firebase-cred.json`

Use this private file as your credential file.

#### Deploying credential file to production
Sometimes your cloud provider may not provide you with storage for secret files. 
So convert the credential file to base64 using
```
base64 firebase-cred.json > encoded.txt
```
Now copy the contents of encoded.txt and paste it in `FIREBASE_ENCODED="wedde"` variable
